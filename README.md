The idea for the project is to create an “On room - online voting system using Azure Blockchain”. We will deploy following features:
1.	Identity verification using Adhar number and Face Detection.
2.	The verification won’t be done if some other person is being detected in room as, the user will be asked to scan his/her complete room to prevent threatening.
3.	The data will then be transferred to the Election Commission concerned member (in our case it would be our two or three personal laptop for demonstration) and on tapping the favoured Election party name it would get updated in system of all the members. Result will immediately be displayed on App.
4.	Data Encryption will also be done on user’s id to prevent data leakage.
